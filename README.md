### 🛠️ Technical Stack

## How It Works

### User Flow

```
User creates link with name, URL, message
  ↓
Visitor clicks short link
  ↓
Arrives at interstitial page with ?code=ABC123
  ↓
Step 1 (3s): Link name + timer instructions
  ↓
Step 2 (3s): Simple timer wait
  ↓
Step 3 (10s): Custom message + disclaimer + click to continue
  ↓
User clicks button → redirects to destination URL
  ↓
Ads shown on all steps (sidebars + anchor bar)
  ↓
Attribution tracked (?adm=CODE) throughout flow
  ↓
Impressions logged and validated for payouts
```

### Payout Flow

```
Month N: Traffic accumulates
  ↓
Month N+1: AdSense calculates revenue
  ↓
Day 21-22 of Month N+1: AdSense pays out
  ↓
Day 1 of Month N+2: GitHub Action runs
  ↓
Script fetches events from Google Sheets
  ↓
Validates impressions (viewability, IVT filter)
  ↓
Calculates units per ADM code
  ↓
Applies 1% wallet cap with overflow
  ↓
Walletless proceeds → founder
  ↓
Distributes payouts to qualified wallets
```

## Bootstrap Phase (January - March 2026)

ADMENSION launched with a **3-month bootstrap phase** to ensure sustainable long-term payouts.

**Bootstrap Policies:**
- ⚠️ **No payouts during Months 1-2** (Jan-Feb 2026)
- 📅 **First payout:** April 1, 2026 (for March activity)
- 💰 **Pool rate:** 6.5% during bootstrap (50% of normal 13%)
- 📈 **After Month 3:** Full 13% pool + monthly payouts resume
- 🔢 **Units tracked:** All contribution tracked during bootstrap for transparency

**Why Bootstrap?**
1. Validate system stability with real traffic
2. Confirm AdSense revenue consistency
3. Test anti-abuse and IVT filters
4. Build user confidence with proven model
5. Ensure sustainable long-term payouts

**Dynamic UI:** The homepage automatically shows bootstrap status and auto-hides the notice after Month 3.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need an account?**  
A: No. The system works entirely in your browser.

**Q: Are payouts guaranteed?**  
A: No. Payouts exist only after real revenue settles from AdSense.

**Q: Can I use this on my own domain?**  
A: Yes. Deploy to your own GitHub Pages or any static host.

**Q: What if I don't set a wallet address?**  
A: Your link's proceeds go to the founder wallet (not the pool). This acts as a burn mechanism.

**Q: Is there a referral system?**  
A: No. Revenue is earned purely from ad impressions on your links.

**Q: How do I know the system is fair?**  
A: All code is open-source. Payout calculations are transparent and auditable.

**Q: Can I create multiple links?**  
A: Yes. Each link gets its own unique ADM code.

**Q: What's the minimum payout?**  
A: $20 per wallet per month.

**Q: When do payouts occur?**  
A: Automatically on the 1st of each month (for prior month's validated traffic).
