# CFAMM + ADMENSION — v1.3 (Advanced Publisher Stack)

Generated: 2026-01-03

## Major upgrades (cumulative)
- Publisher diagnostics KPIs (conversion, pages/session, geo mix, duration bins, weighted RPM estimate)
- Admin controls (density toggles per geo tier + CPM assumptions + context skins selector)
- Context skins (copy/meta variants for higher CPM contexts)
- Waterfall scaffolding placeholders (serve logging; no refresh spam)
- Sponsored sticky engine (local): 72h slots, 90-day horizon, hard caps, rotates on user intent only
- Monthly settlement summaries history + projection-based progress bars
- Support modal (optional; no rewards tied)

## v1.3 update (this package)
- Admin hard-lock by route + PIN (/#admin blocked unless unlocked)
- Conditional robots meta for admin route (best-effort noindex/nofollow)
- Context Skin selector (local) to prep domain/context cloning
- Traffic Tier simulator (local) to test density enforcement rules

## Notes
- Static build; no real network code included.
- Revenue metrics are estimates for transparency only, never guarantees.
- Ad safety stance remains: no auto-refresh timers, no incentivized language.
